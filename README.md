### RPI---Creating-A-Custom-Boot-Screen

# Why?
  I initially bought a Raspberry PI because I wanted to create a custom head unit for my car, something very personalized that noone else had in their car. Naturally, the first thing I thought of was a
  a custom boot screen for when the device powered on. Heres how I did it. 

# Step 1. 
  As a test, I just needed to find a quick GIF to run at boot just to show proof of concept, so I created one using Googles AI generator.
